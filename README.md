# RDS-Project
This repository houses the simulation files and report generated for the RDS Project.
(Submission Info: Name: Zach Nobles, UID: znobles)

# How to Run
To run simulation, please download all .mlx files to the same folder and run cmg_simulator. The files have a few images nested to provide context, so please also save all png files to the same folder for clearer documentation in the scripts.

# Animation
An animation tool is commented out at the bottom of the cmg_simulator script. Uncommenting this will increase runtime, but provides a visual tool for assessing the simulation results.

# Report
The report details the objective, methods, and resutls of the experiment. The results are interesting so please read and consider using CMGs for more interesting applcations in the future :)
